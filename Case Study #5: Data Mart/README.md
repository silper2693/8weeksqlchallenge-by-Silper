## 💡 Business Talk
<p align="justify">The analysis indicates that the introduction of sustainable packaging did not result in a significant negative impact on overall sales. While minor declines were observed in certain segments and platforms, transaction volumes remained largely stable, suggesting consistent customer demand. Variations across regions and platforms imply that differences are more likely driven by implementation factors rather than the packaging change itself. Overall, the initiative appears to be strategically sound, with opportunities for further optimization at the segment level.</p>
